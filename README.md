# Smart-Parking-System-using-8051-MCU
A hardware prototype which precisely measures vehicle dimensions and after inferring the type of vehicle, suggests optimal parking spots. The system was simulated on Proteus software, and a well-designed PCB was developed for robust and efficient parking area management.

The simulation was done in Proteus-
